- don't put only import before eg 'use strict' directive
- if it's a local import and there are no existing local imports, should leave a preceding blank line
- does it break to turn off a react/ rule if plugin: react isn't on?
- support require()?
- include existing tests of "base rules"
- maybe belongs in other plugin: try and be smart enough to detect that the unused var is part of an object dereferencing and can be safely removed?
- figure out how to release without committing lib/

config:
- support yaml
- allow specifying config "inline" in eslintrc
- put under "imports" key in known-imports
- merge multiple sources intelligently
