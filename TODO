- support require()?
- include existing tests of "base rules"
- maybe belongs in other plugin: try and be smart enough to detect that the unused var is part of an object dereferencing and can be safely removed?
- update README
- rule that just looks for places that don't follow the formatting of [nonlocal imports] [blank line] [local imports] [blank line]?
- for whitelist, allow to specify extensions which should be explicitly included in generated import name (settings['known-imports/extensions'] as an object eg {'.coffee': {includeExtensionInImport: yes}}?)
- allow specifying everything in config file or eslint config (eg allow blank-line-before-local-imports in config file)
- specify min node version in package.json engines or transpile object spread?
- allow whitelisting things other than directories eg glob, single file
- blacklists (to refine whitelists) - allow to specify blacklisted names, paths?
- relative priority of whitelist filename vs named?
  including priority in the sense of being able to specify a different whitelist for a subdirectory (eg whitelist filenames for src/ but only whitelist named imports for src/util/)
- clarity about how known-imports/extensions relates to import extensions? rename extensions to known-imports/filename-whitelist-extensions?
- restrict known import to path/glob? eg make render mean react-testing-library inside test files
