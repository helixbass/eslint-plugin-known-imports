- support require()?
- include existing tests of "base rules"
- maybe belongs in other plugin: try and be smart enough to detect that the unused var is part of an object dereferencing and can be safely removed?
- update README
- rule that just looks for places that don't follow the formatting of [nonlocal imports] [blank line] [local imports] [blank line]?
- looks like it wipes out following comment when removing last import
