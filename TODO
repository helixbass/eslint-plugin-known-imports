- does it break to turn off a react/ rule if plugin: react isn't on?
- support require()?
- include existing tests of "base rules"
- maybe belongs in other plugin: try and be smart enough to detect that the unused var is part of an object dereferencing and can be safely removed?
- figure out how to release without committing lib/
